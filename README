NAME
    App::Prove::Plugin::Idempotent - a prove plugin to keep output TAP
    reusable

SYNOPSIS
     prove -P Idempotent t/foo.t

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin tries to keep the verbose output of `prove' to be the same
    TAP as it consumed. In particular, the final `ok' line that is normally
    added is left out. Therefore you can reuse the output TAP stream and
    feed it again into a TAP parser.
